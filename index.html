                Nearly a decade of hype led to a troubled release riddled with glitches, a livid fan base, refunds for potentially millions of players and a possible class-action lawsuit.

                    The hype around Cyberpunk 2077 had been building for nearly a decade.

                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    When CD Projekt Red, the Polish studio behind the video game, announced the title in 2012, it was billed as a gripping, free-flowing saga that would immerse players in a lifelike sci-fi universe. Since then, fans have been treated to impressive teaser trailers, buy-in from celebrities including Keanu Reeves, Grimes and ASAP Rocky, and headlines heralding it as the most anticipated title of the year, if not the century.
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    The game is set in a dystopian future where digital nomads navigate a high-stakes world of corporate espionage (with Mr. Reeves as their guide) and augment their bodies with high-tech weaponry. Players, especially those using next-generation consoles from Sony and Microsoft, were promised a revolutionary experience, with extensive character customization options and an expansive world to explore. Eight million people pre-ordered copies, sight unseen, ahead of its December release.

                <div class="paragraph">
                    In July 2018, as anticipation for the game neared a crescendo across Twitter, one user tweeted at the official Cyberpunk 2077 account: “Will there be memes in the game?” The account responded: “Whole game is going to be a meme.”
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    The tweet was somewhat prescient — but not in the way developers had hoped.                
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    Since the release of Cyberpunk 2077 on Dec. 10, thousands of gamers have created viral videos featuring a multitude of glitches and bugs — many hilarious — that mar the game. They include tiny trees covering the floors of buildings, tanks falling from the sky and characters standing up, inexplicably pantless, while riding motorcycles.                
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    These videos depict a game that is virtually unplayable: rife with errors, populated by characters running on barely functional artificial intelligence, and largely incompatible with the older gaming consoles meant to support it. Fans are livid.

                The View From Warsaw

                <div class="paragraph">
                    CD Projekt Red was founded in Warsaw in the 1990s by two high school friends, Marcin Iwiński and Michał Kiciński, during a time of transformation and growth in the gaming industry. (CD-ROM discs were a novel innovation back then.) The two began importing games from the United States, and essentially repackaging and republishing them in Poland.                
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    “By the time school was out we had both become truants, skipping classes to play games,” Mr. Iwiński said in an oral history of the studio.                
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    Early employees who spoke to The New York Times described the company’s leaders as deft marketers, storytellers and artistic visionaries. They said that their enthusiasm for their games often ran ahead of their engineering and technical prowess. The employees spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.                
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    The company’s ambitions were astronomical early on, as were some of its failures. In the early aughts, CD Projekt Red made a play to develop The Witcher, a popular series of books by the Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski, into an immersive video game franchise.                
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div id="righttwo">
            <div class="maintext">
                <div class="paragraph">
                    But the first Witcher game, released in 2007, was buggy and stuffed with more features than it could support. Former employees who worked on the game said it would take three to five minutes to load basic screens.
                </div>              
                <div class="paragraph">
                    Employees said that during game development, there was a general attitude of building more things themselves rather than sometimes licensing other so-called “middleware” — or supporting software — from other companies with greater expertise. As a result, the developers created worse versions of features that had been perfected by other companies.
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    Still, the Witcher series gained the studio an early following and fan base. The studio received the most acclaim for The Witcher 3, which won awards for its detailed universe and rich storytelling. Like earlier titles, it was buggy from the outset, frustrating players. But most fans accepted what they saw as a kind of test-and-release culture around CD Projekt Red games: a willingness to put out projects that were not yet problem-free.

                    Then came Cyberpunk 2077. First announced in 2012 and based loosely on a tabletop role-playing game created in 1988, the title was CD Projekt Red’s first attempt at creating a new, futuristic world.                
                </div>              
                <div class="paragraph">
                    It was to be set in Night City, a darkly dystopian megacity where humans and machines were fused together and repackaged as mercenaries, carrying out sabotage missions against evil corporations. The game would combine elements from some of sci-fi’s greatest hits: Strange Days meets Blade Runner meshed with The Matrix.
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    To hammer that point home, CD Projekt Red cast a familiar famous face in the game: Keanu Reeves. At a development conference in 2019, the actor burst onto the stage in a cloud of smoke after a video revealed his character.
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    “Let me tell you, the feeling of being there, of walking the streets of the future, is really going to be breathtaking,” Mr. Reeves said at the event. (A spokeswoman for Mr. Reeves did not respond to a request for comment.)

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        Inside CD Projekt Red, it was a very different story. Developers were increasingly concerned with some of the grand promises being made by management on the promotional marketing tour. Far into the game’s development, former employees said, the hyper-customizable and endlessly explorable world being sold to players was nowhere close to manifesting.
                    </div>              
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        By 2019, chatter began to circulate in Polish game development circles that CD Projekt Red was way behind schedule with Cyberpunk 2077, even with a release date set for the following April. Some saw the departure of top executives — including key board members — as major warning signs.
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        On Glassdoor, a site where people can rate their previous employers, current and former CD Projekt Red workers said there was chaos behind the scenes: Office rumors spreading on Discord servers, misleading deadlines set by managers, infighting among the company’s top brass, and incompetence and poor planning leading to unnecessary “crunch,” a term for overworking employees to produce games under a tight deadline. Longtime engineering staff left the company as a result of overwork.
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        “The owners treat the company as a machine to earn money, and do not see employees as people but more like data in the table,” one former employee wrote on the site.

                        This January, CD Projekt Red tweeted that the game’s release had been delayed until Sept. 17, because there was “still work to be done.” Then, in March, the coronavirus pandemic caused CD Projekt Red to send its work force home.
                    </div>              
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        Though the company said remote work would not hurt Cyberpunk’s chances of a September release, executives eventually announced further delays. The game was pushed to Nov. 19 in order to “fix a lot of bugs.” It was the same story in October, when the game’s release date was pushed to Dec. 10, at the height of the holiday shopping season.
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        Inside CD Projekt Red, as executives and communications staff geared up for a wide release, the problems were evident. While developers had created a functioning game for PC users, Cyberpunk was glitchy and crashed frequently on next-generation consoles like the PlayStation 5 and the new Xbox devices. Even worse, the game barely ran on older consoles like the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        Typically, game developers send early copies of new titles to reviewers with ample lead time. But CD Projekt Red kept Cyberpunk 2077 under wraps for as long as it could. The company only shared advance copies of the PC version with gaming publications and news organizations, previewing the best possible version of Cyberpunk to reviewers who would post their ratings online just days before the game’s release.
                    </div>

                        For months, reviewers, including those at The New York Times, tried to obtain review copies for the new game consoles released by Sony and Microsoft this year. Stephanie Bayer, a spokeswoman for CD Projekt Red, said in a previous email correspondence that the company would “hold off sending our console codes until close to launch” so that they could “send them securely.” That never happened.
                    </div>              
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        Early reviews mentioned some issues with bugs, but the impressions were largely positive. Excitement continued to build until the game was released on Thursday, Dec. 10.

                    <div class="paragraph">
                        Eager fans were thrilled to finally be playing the game for the first time. Ashley Shoate, a D.J. in Northville, Mich., said she was amazed at the detail on her PlayStation 5, and loved the ability to customize her character, literally, to the teeth.
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        Then came the bugs. Ms. Shoate said it was impossible for her character to complete basic tasks like running, dodging and picking up weapons. Steering a car was so challenging that she felt like she was “drunk driving.” On one mission, Ms. Shoate had to sneak up and kill an enemy with a katana sword.

                        Billy Marte, an account executive at a software company in Austin, Texas, said he bought into the high expectations and the commercials with Mr. Reeves. Playing on his PC, he loved the story line and missions, but was often frustrated by glitches that made his character stand up while riding a motorcycle, or forced him to backtrack to an earlier saved game. Some of his friends, he said, had decided to return Cyberpunk.
